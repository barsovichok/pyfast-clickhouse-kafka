# PyFast-Clickhouse-Kafka

PyFast-Clickhouse-Kafka is a microservice architecture that leverages FastAPI, ClickHouse, Kafka, and other modern technologies to deliver a high-performance data processing and analytics platform. This setup is ideal for scenarios where data needs to be ingested, processed, and queried in real-time.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of the following components:

1. **FastAPI** - Provides a RESTful API interface for interacting with the data.
2. **Kafka** - Used as the message broker for real-time data streaming.
3. **ClickHouse** - A columnar database management system (DBMS) optimized for analytical queries.
4. **PostgreSQL** - Used for managing user data and other relational data.
5. **Kafka-UI** - Provides a web interface for monitoring and managing Kafka clusters.
6. **Tabix** - A web-based UI for managing and querying ClickHouse databases.

## Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **FastAPI**
- **SQLModel** (built on SQLAlchemy and Pydantic)
- **PostgreSQL**
- **ClickHouse**
- **Apache Kafka**
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose**

## Services and Instruments

1. **FastAPI Application** - The core application, which provides RESTful API endpoints.
2. **Kafka** - For handling data streams and ensuring that data is processed in real-time.
3. **ClickHouse** - Used for storing and querying large volumes of data with high efficiency.
4. **PostgreSQL** - A relational database for handling user data and other structured data needs.
5. **Kafka-UI** - A graphical interface to monitor Kafka clusters.
6. **Tabix** - A GUI for managing ClickHouse databases, useful for running and visualizing SQL queries.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of FastAPI, Kafka, and ClickHouse.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/barsovichok/pyfast-clickhouse-kafka.git
    cd pyfast-clickhouse-kafka
    ```

2. Build and start the Docker containers:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. Access the services:
    - **FastAPI**: `http://localhost:8000`
    - **Kafka-UI**: `http://localhost:8082`
    - **Tabix**: `http://localhost:8080`

### Environment Variables

Make sure to configure your `.env` file to manage environment-specific configurations such as database connections, Kafka settings, etc.

## API Examples

### 1. Send an Event to Kafka
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/data/send_event \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "event_type": "create_user",
  "description": "User created"
}'
```

### 2. Get Events from ClickHouse
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/data/get_events \
-H 'accept: application/json'
```

### 3. Create a New User in PostgreSQL
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users/ \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "username": "newuser",
  "email": "newuser@example.com",
  "first_name": "New",
  "last_name": "User"
}'
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you can use:

```bash
pytest
```

This will execute all the test cases defined in the `tests` directory.
